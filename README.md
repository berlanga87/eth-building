# Building Contract
#### *Author*: Carlos Berlanga

## Summary

This project is an Ethereum contract and web interface that represents the ownership of units in a building. The contract allows you to list, unlist and purchase a unit, as well as prove ownership in each of them.

To run this in a local network:

1) Start a ganache-cli instance on port 8545 (default)
2) Compile and migrate the contract with `truffle migrate`
3) Run `npm install` in the `src` folder to install all required dependencies
4) Run a dev server with `npm run dev`
5) Open `localhost:3000` in your browser
